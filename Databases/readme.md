    * a collection of data/information
    * that has an interface

    *SQL - in tables, relational, and strictly categorical--if a category is added for one user, it must be added for all as null/nil whatever.
    * non-SQL - not "flat", in objects that can have nested inner layers, written in "BJSON"--Binary JS Object Notation.
