# Databases

## Intro to Databases
* What is a database?
    * a collection of data/information
    * that has an interface
* SQL(relational) vs NoSQL(non-relational)
    *SQL - in tables, relational, and strictly categorical--if a category is added for one user, it must be added for all as null/nil whatever.
    * non-SQL - not "flat", in objects that can have nested inner layers, written in "BJSON"--Binary JS Object Notation.
